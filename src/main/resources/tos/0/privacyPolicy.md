## Information Terra May Collect From You

1. Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide genomic information management and analysis services to you, to improve our Site, features, content, and to run our business.

    1. Genomic Information That You Voluntarily Provide

        * Terra collects and stores the genomic sequence data (DNA, RNA, etc), derived from humans or other organisms, that you submit to the Site along with metadata and other information related to such sequence data. You agree to and accept full responsibility for obtaining all necessary permissions and informed consents from the donors of all samples from which your submitted sequence data is derived.

    2. HIPAA, Protected Health Information, and the Clinical Compliance Features

        * Terra is not a Covered Entity as that term is defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its related regulations (collectively, "HIPAA"). On occasion, Terra may agree in writing with a user to perform services for the user in the storing PHI. We recommend that such users enter into a formal agreement with Terra/Firecloud.

        * Terra does offers clinical compliance features as part of its service ("Compliance Features") for users who wish to upload, store, or otherwise transfer PHI, as well as users who are using the Site in connection with their clinical operations. Users who desire to upload, store, or otherwise transfer PHI using the Site must implement all of the required Clinical Features and must enter a formal agreement with Firecloud stating that. The uploading, storing, or transferring of PHI using the Site by users that have not implemented the Clinical Features is strictly prohibited. You agree that, unless you have implemented the Clinical Features, you will not upload, store, or otherwise transfer PHI using the Site.

        * You acknowledge that this may require you, in some instances, to anonymize sequence data prior to uploading it to the Site. You further agree to indemnify and hold harmless Terra of and from any and all claims, demands, losses, causes of action, damage, lawsuits, judgments, including attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or relating to your uploading, storing, or transferring of PHI without having fully implemented the Clinical Features.
