Thanks for using Terra! Terra is a platform developed by Verily,
Microsoft and The Broad Institute that enables Users to curate and
publish datasets, discover and access data, find and leverage tools, and
collaborate with others. These Terms of Service apply to your use of
Terra, as described in Section 2 and as operated by The Broad Institute.

The mission of Terra is to enable the next generation of collaborative
The mission of Terra is to enable the next generation of collaborative
biomedical research by building an open platform that connects
researchers to each other and to the datasets and tools they need to
achieve scientific breakthroughs. The success of that mission depends on
User contributions of Content, and so we encourage you to support this
vibrant environment by making Content available for use and analysis by
other Users.

Your use of Terra requires that you agree to these Terms, which also
include the Acceptable Use Policy and the Customer Security
Requirements. Please read these materials carefully. If you are
accessing Terra on behalf of a company or entity, you represent that you
have the legal authority to enter into these Terms on that entity’s
behalf and agree that we may also contact such entity if you violate
these Terms or the Acceptable Use Policy or Customer Security
Requirements. If you do not understand these Terms, or do not accept any
part of them, then do not use Terra.

## 2. Your Use of Terra

**Non-Commercial Use.** Non-Commercial Users may use Terra for research,
sharing reproducible research, developing scientific software tools,
making data and scientific software tools available to the scientific
community, teaching and educational activities, and/or sponsored
research, regardless of the identity of the sponsor, provided that, for
sponsored research: (i) the primary effect of such sponsorship is not to
permit a commercial sponsor to profit from access to or use of Terra,
(ii) a commercial sponsor is not permitted to access Terra except in an
incidental manner in the course of such collaboration, and (iii) you do
not access or use Terra to comply with the express directions of a
commercial sponsor.

If your employer has reached an enterprise level agreement with The
Broad Institute governing your use of Terra, these terms will apply in
areas where they are additional to that agreement but will not amend or
supervene the governing enterprise level agreement.

**For-Profit Entities or other Commercial Use.** For-Profit Entities,
and anyone making use of Terra that is not described in “Non-Commercial
Use” above, may use Terra only under the terms of a Commercial Agreement
with Microsoft or Verily, which will govern, or for the following
limited circumstances:

1. Accessing specific Public Datasets via Terra to the extent that
   the owner of the Public Dataset has made such Public Dataset available
   to Users that include For-Profit Entities. If such owner has
   designated a specific purpose for such Public Dataset, a For-Profit
   Entity may use such Public Dataset only for such designated purpose.
   Access by a For-Profit Entity to Public Datasets through Terra under
   this exception may include using Terra to work across Public Datasets,
   but does not extend to working in connection with any data,
   information, material, documents, or other Content outside of a Public
   Dataset and the software and tools provided for use with a Public
   Dataset.

2. Incidental access to Terra as part of a collaboration between a
   For-Profit Entity and a Non-Profit Entity.

And/or

3. If either Microsoft or Verily has approved you or your company
   to have an evaluation license, the limited use of Terra under these
   Terms for the sole purpose of evaluating whether to enter into a
   Commercial Agreement.

**Your Conduct.** Don’t misuse Terra. You may use Terra only as
permitted by Law, including applicable export and re-export control laws
and regulations, and in accordance with the Acceptable Use Policy. You
are responsible for your conduct and your Content Connected to Terra. By
accessing Terra, you acknowledge and agree that we may monitor your
conduct, your use of Terra, and your Content to filter spam, viruses,
and other malware, ensure interoperability, fix bugs and resolve
problems, ensure compliance with these Terms, the Acceptable Use Policy,
Customer Security Requirements, and Law, provide you with help desk
services and support, and that our understanding of the way Users
interact with Terra may be used to improve Terra. This analysis may
occur when you Connect Content to Terra or access Content Connected to
Terra. We may Remove or refuse to display Content that we reasonably
believe is spam, viruses, or other malware, not interoperable, not in
compliance with these Terms, the Acceptable Use Policy, Customer
Security Requirements, or Law, or is used outside of a restriction on
its use. If you request technical support, we may also use eyes on
monitoring to provide you with such technical support. When using or
accessing Content other than your Content, you agree to comply with all
restrictions and controls imposed by the owner of that Content. Within
Terra workspaces and repositories, owners have the ability to allow
other users access, or remove and exclude users entirely. Further, for
those granted access to a workspace or repository, the owner can assign
roles that limit access and use rights in a range of ways and revoke
access previously granted. Note, though, that where you have previously
granted access, and allowed others to acquire copies of your Content or
related Metadata, your revocation of future access will not pull back or
retrieve Content or Metadata in the hands of others through previously
granted access. Finally an owner may impose terms or restrictions
through separate agreements with users. You may not access any data
through Terra, or make any use of Terra functionality, other than access
and use authorized by the owners, and may not try to defeat, disable, or
otherwise avoid any technical mechanisms deployed within Terra to
maintain or enforce any limitations on access or use.

**Your Terra Account.** In order to use Terra, you will need to register
for a Terra account using an account from a Compatible Cloud. You may
not access Terra using group or shared accounts. The credentials used
for authenticating to Terra must belong to a single individual and only
that individual may use those credentials. To protect your Terra
account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the
activity that happens on or through your Terra account. Try not to reuse
your Terra account password on third-party applications. If you learn of
any unauthorized use of your password or Terra account, contact us
immediately.

**Accessing a Government Website.** To the extent you have selected
research data from certain U.S. Government sources, you acknowledge that
the following terms apply: (1) Users are accessing a U.S. Government
information system; (2) Information system usage may be monitored,
recorded and subject to audit; (3) Unauthorized use of the information
system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and
(4) Use of the information system indicates consent to monitoring and
recording.

**Terra Security Requirements.** To use Terra, you must comply with any
and all security requirements that we make available at
<https://terra.bio/resources/security/> or such other location as we may
notify you of, including in the Customer Security Requirements. Users
must ensure that your Web browsers use Transport Layer Security (TLS)
1.2 (or higher). SSL and TLS must use a minimum of 256-bit encryption.

**Announcements.** In connection with your use of Terra, we may send you
service announcements, administrative messages, and other information.
You may opt out of some of these communications.

**Retained Rights.** Using Terra does not give you ownership of any
intellectual property rights in Terra or the Content you access. You may
not use Content Connected to Terra unless you obtain permission from its
owner or are otherwise permitted by Law. These Terms do not grant you
the right to use any branding or logos used in Terra. Don’t remove,
obscure, or alter any marks, designations, or legal notices displayed in
or along with Terra.

**Age Restrictions.** In order to use Terra you must be 18 years of age
or older, unless you are accessing Terra in connection with your
activities using your account authorized by a Non-Profit Entity, in
which case you must be 16 years of age or older.

**No Medical Advice.** Terra does not provide medical advice. All
Content Connected to Terra is for informational purposes only and is not
a substitute for professional medical advice or treatment. Always seek
the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any
questions you may have regarding your health. Never disregard
professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something
you have read on Terra. If you think you may have a medical emergency,
call your doctor or 911 immediately. We do not recommend or endorse any
specific tests, physicians, products, procedures, opinions, or other
information that may be mentioned on Terra. Reliance on any information
provided by us, available on Terra, or by other Users is solely at your
own risk.

## 3. Content

**Your Content.** Terra enables you to Connect and access Content. You
are never required to Connect Content to Terra. You retain ownership of
any intellectual property rights that you hold in that Content. You
control who can access your Content Connected to Terra. Your Content
will never be shared through Terra with any other User in violation of
the access restrictions and assigned roles you establish for your
Content.

**Permitted Uses.** When you Connect Content to Terra, you give us a non-exclusive,
royalty-free, worldwide license to use that Content for the limited
purposes of (a) providing Terra and the Content Connected to Terra to
you, (b) providing support to you in connection with your use of and
access to Terra, (c) making your Content available to other Users
authorized by you via Terra’s functionality for such purpose and
supporting such access and use, each in accordance with the restrictions
and roles established by you, (d) using Metadata to maintain, test and
improve Terra, and (e) to comply with any Law. The license to your
Metadata (but not your Content itself) continues even if you stop using
Terra or Remove your Content. Your revocation of access previously
granted to one or more users will cut off future access of those users
to your Content through the accounts you control. If, though, you have
previously permitted other users to copy Content to their own accounts,
your revocation of access will not pull back the copied Content. Those
users may have ongoing access to the copies you have previously
permitted, and this use will be permitted under this license. We will
never let any third party (other than a third party we engage to
exercise our rights under these Terms, including operating Terra) access
your Content without your permission, and will never access or use your
Content (including letting our employees and other representatives
access your Content) for any purpose not allowed by these Terms without
a separate agreement between you and us. You agree that we may engage
third parties to exercise our rights under these Terms, including
operating Terra.

Terra provides certain functionality that will allow You to restrict
access to workspaces and repositories, and, within a workspace or
repository, assign Users roles that may have limited access to data or
certain functionalities. You are solely responsible for the
configuration, setting and use of these functionalities. Terra will not
manage, review or otherwise correct any errors You may make in how these
functionalities are configured, set or used. You are also responsible
for ensuring you have the rights to Connect your Content, share your
Content with any Users, and allow Users to access or use your Content in
accordance with any applicable regulation, any contractual or other
legal duties you may have, and in compliance with any proprietary rights
any third parties may have in your Content. Finally, You are responsible
for keeping backups of your Content. We take no responsibility for your
Content and do not and will not provide any back-up, archive, or
restoration functionality.

We have no obligation to review Content Connected to Terra, so please
don’t assume that we do. We understand the importance of the
confidentiality of your Content, including where applicable that your
Content may be protected by law, such as by a Certificate of
Confidentiality. If no exception at Law (for example, a Certificate of
Confidentiality) applies, and we determine we are required by Law to do
so, we may make any Content Connected to Terra available to a court,
regulatory agency, or other government entity, including in connection
with subpoenas, investigations, inquiries, examinations, or audits.
Where the Law permits, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you
before making any Content available to a court, agency or other
government entity.

**Feedback.** We welcome you to provide ideas, suggestions, and other
feedback about Terra! There is no requirement that you provide us any
feedback. If you do provide any ideas, suggestions, or other feedback
about Terra, you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free,
sublicensable, transferable, non-exclusive, worldwide right and license
to use that feedback for any lawful purposes.

a separate agreement. Your use of such additional products and services
is subject to those separate agreements.

of these Terms, with a right to enforce these Terms directly against
you. Otherwise, these Terms do not create any third party beneficiary
rights.
